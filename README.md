# AWS Documentation Corpus

Developers who work with AWS need to read a lot of their documentation, and so learners who are training to be developers who work with AWS need to train to read the docs.

This project is aimed at compiling a corpus of AWS documentation to be investigated as to what interesting treasures it holds. It's quite likely that nothing super interesting will be found, but we also might be also to use it to create materials for learners.

Additionally, in conjuction with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure docs, we might be able to make a stronger case for what types of reading a cloud engineer needs to be able to do.

## grab the docs

```
./grab_docs.sh
```

and everything should show up in the `./docs` folder.
